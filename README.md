# dotfiles

Each repository contains the dotfiles and/or the configuration of a specific
piece of software. Deploying the dotfiles is supposed to be done manually.
This is because different computers might need different additions to the
configuration e.g. work-specific config. The files provided here are a solid
bedrock to start upon.
